# Ship Release Branch Skill

## Overview
This skill guides the agent in shipping a release branch by creating and publishing a GitHub release pointing to the tip of the release branch. It ensures consistency by:
1. Resolving the release version directly from `self.versions.toml` on the target release branch (never assuming the branch name matches the version name, as hotfixes are appended to existing release branches with a 4th/hotfix version segment). The android versionCode / iOS build number is derived from the name via `scripts/version-code.py` — see the Versioning section of `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` for the formula.
2. Extracting release notes from the corresponding section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Publishing the GitHub release using the `gh` CLI with matching tag name and release name (format: `v<VERSION>`).
4. The tag push triggers `.github/workflows/build-installers.yml`, which builds the deb/msi/dmg installers + a signed release APK and attaches them to the release created in step 3 (the iOS shard is best-effort and doesn't gate the release).

## Dependencies
- `release-branch-skill`: Typically run after a release branch is cut and hardened.

## Prerequisites
- **Merge PRs via GitHub**: Ensure the version bump PR (and any hardening PRs) are merged via the GitHub UI or `gh pr merge`. **NEVER** use local merge commits on the release branch.
- **Pull Latest**: Once PRs are merged on GitHub, checkout the release branch locally and pull the latest changes from `origin` to ensure the local branch is up-to-date before starting the release process.
- **Verify Versions**: `iosApp/Configuration/Config.xcconfig` must be in sync with the `name` in `self.versions.toml` (via `scripts/sync-ios-version.sh`). The script derives the versionCode from the name, verifies the xcconfig sync, and refuses to ship from a non-`release/*` branch.

## Quick Start
To perform a dry-run and verify release notes/version before shipping:
```bash
./scripts/ship-release.py --dry-run --output /tmp/release-dry-run.json
```

To ship the current release branch:
```bash
./scripts/ship-release.py --output /tmp/release-result.json
```

## Utility Scripts
The skill uses the `./scripts/ship-release.py` script.

### Arguments
- `--branch <branch>`: Target branch/ref to point the release to (defaults to current branch). Must be a `release/*` branch (warning only on dry-run).
- `--dry-run`: Prints release details and the `gh` command without executing them.
- `--output <file_path>`: (Required) Path to write a JSON report of the release results.

### Example JSON output (`/tmp/release-result.json`):
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "dry_run": false,
  "tag": "v1.0.0",
  "title": "v1.0.0",
  "version_code": "100000000",
  "branch": "release/v1.0.0",
  "url": "https://github.com/episode6/podcast-hacker/releases/tag/v1.0.0",
  "notes": "- Initial release: subscribe, download (ads cut) and play podcasts..."
}
```

## After Shipping
- Watch the `build-installers.yml` run triggered by the new tag; when it finishes, verify the deb/msi/dmg + APK are attached to the release and carry the right version.

## Common Mistakes
1. **Shipping from a non-release branch**: `main` always carries a releasable-looking plain version in this repo (no `-SNAPSHOT` markers), so the script refuses to ship unless the target is a `release/*` branch.
2. **Out-of-sync xcconfig**: every `name` change must be followed by `scripts/sync-ios-version.sh`; the script fails if `Config.xcconfig` doesn't match the name / derived versionCode.
3. **Missing Changelog Section**: Forgetting to update `CHANGELOG.md` with the release version. The script will fail if the section matching `v<VERSION>` cannot be found.
4. **Mismatched release notes**: Assuming the release notes can be typed manually. Always extract them directly from `CHANGELOG.md` using the script to avoid discrepancies.
5. **Stale Local Branch**: Forgetting to pull the latest changes from `origin` before shipping, which can lead to releasing an outdated version of the code.
